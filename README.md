# homework-2
This is my Week 2 assignment for the UW Full-Stack Development Bootcamp. This assignment is a framework for a portfolio to display projects you have completed. This assignment specifically calls for; 
-developer name, recent photo or avatar, links to "about me", links to their work and how to contact them
-Navigation links to take you to the corresponding portion of the webpage
-Clicking links of projects will take the user to the deployed page of the developers application
-When the first application is displayed, it is portrayed larger than other projects. 
-Clicking on the link to their work will take you to the portion of the page with their work
-Resizing the page or viewing on various devices will present with a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
